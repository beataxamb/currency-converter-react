# **MY SIMPLE CURRENCY CONVERTER IN REACT.JS**

## **Demo**
https://beataxamb.github.io/currency-converter-react/

## **Description**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I am taking a programming course and I made this currency converter for my homework. This website contains a simple currency calculator that shows how to do calculations using java script. I also added css styles to improve the visual appearance of the calculator to make it more pleasant to use.

**I invite you to see the effects of my work!**

## **How to use?**

In the upper window, enter the amount in zlotys, but not less than 10. Then select the currency and click the button "przelicz". Below you will see the amount you will get in the currency you have chosen. If you want to enter a different amount, you can delete it by clicking on the button "Wyczyść".

### **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
